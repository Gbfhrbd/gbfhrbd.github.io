# Open Source Portal at SK telecom

Welcome to the GitHub repository for open source portal website at SK telecom. The portal are hosted at http://sktelecom.github.io/. 

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organization in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown, and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

We also heavily referenced the format and design of the [Kubeflow docs](https://github.com/kubeflow/website) website.
